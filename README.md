# Modding Tool BMFont2SCS (MT-bmfont2scs) by Soundwave2142 for ETS2/ATS

A simple converter of BMFont file `.fnt` to SCS' `.font` format for ETS2 and ATS games.
Original idea by Etrusan.

---

## How to use

1. Got to [releases section](https://github.com/Soundwave2142/MT-bmfont2scs/releases) of `MT-bmfont2scs` and download latest relase
2. Extract contents of ZIP file anywhere and open `bmfont2scs.html` in your browser
3. Click "select file" button and select BMFont's `.fnt` file
4. The script will generate an archive with `.font` + `.mat` + `.tobj` files for you and start a download in browser

It is recommended to set up the right path in your .fnt file `file=<path>` before converting. That path will be used
in all generated files.
